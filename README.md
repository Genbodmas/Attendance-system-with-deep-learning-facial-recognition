# Attendance-system-with-deep-learning-facial-recognition
`Run app.py` to start the program
## Face detection and capturing
  face detection:
  `face detect.py`  
  face capturing:
  `face capturing.py`
  
## Creating facelist and recognition
  facelist:
  `face update.py`  
  recognition:
  `face recognition.py`
  
### To Note 
 -running `face update.py` creates a .pth file on your storage which is used to store the embeddings  
 -remember to change all path links  
 -change cv2.Videocapture to 0 if using webcam and 1 if using usb camera
